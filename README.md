# FMI-Semester-1-Project-1-Who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-

Hello, and welcome to my first project in FMI!
I am going to briefly explain how the game works and the rules!

1. When you enter each menu, there is an option to go back to the previous menu, and an option to close the 
game from the main menu!

2. When the game tells you what to what to input or type, please input one of the options that the game
provides you with. The game is secured and won't accept incorrect answers and will give you the option to 
enter again untill you enter a valid choice! (it may be a number from 1 to 9, or a certain number or a symbol
(example: A) or anything like that!) 

3. When the game asks you something and the choices are yes/no, please type 'yes' or 'no!', but dont forget 
the exclamation mark!!!!

4. When you start new game, you have options form 1-5, each one is different topic, option 9 is for all topics

5. Topic "Life" is a topic that contains different types of topics(physics, proverbs, mind tricky questions and so 
on).

6. The game has 15 questions, from 1-5 are the easy ones, from 6-10 are the medium ones, and from 11-15 are 
the hard ones!

7. You have 3 jokers, 50/50, calling a friend and help from the audience

8. The last two jokers have a 30% chance of lying when the question is easy, 60% on avarage questions and
80% on hard questions.

9. Each question gives you a sum of money, after each question you have the ability to end the run, keep the 
money and stop the game, after completing question 5 you will be having a sum of money if you lose before 
completing level 10, same goes to level 10 and level 15, after winning , you will win 1.000.000 million dollars!

10. If you choose the option to add new question, please add a serious question and follow the steps!

11. Editing existing question isn't working for the moment

12. Have fun!
